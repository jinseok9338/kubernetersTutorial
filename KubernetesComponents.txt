Node = virtual machine that holds servers 
pod = smallest unit of K8s/ Abstraction over container. (There is usually one container in one pod)
Each pod gets its own IP address
Service = permanent IP address (external Service is accessible from outside but not the internal service)
Ingress = request goes to the ingress first and forwarded to the services
Database URL usually in the built application(image from docker hub)
ComfigMap =  external configuration of your application
Secret is just like configMap used to store secret data base64 encoded
Data Storage(volume) is attached to the container for the persistent data = storage on the local machine of remote cloud storage
If my pod dies(down time), the services are replicated to multiple nodes but they are connected to the same services
Services are also load balancer
Deployment is blueprint for my-app pods = abstraction of pods 
DB can't be replicated through Deployment becuase it holds the data so StatefulSet is used
 
Kubernetes Architecture
Each node has multiple Pods on it/ 3 processes must be installed on every nodes
Node should have the runtime such as Docker 
Kubelet interacts with both the container and node
Kubelet starts the pod with a container inside
Kube Proxy forwards the requests just like service

how do you interat with the cluster 
how to schedule pod/ monitor/ reschedule and restart/ join a new Nodes 
They are done through Master node/process
